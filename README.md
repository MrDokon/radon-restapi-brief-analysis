# Brief analysis of RAD-on REST API Selected Resources

The repository contains selected charts from the analysis presented in my bachelor's thesis on RAD on REST APIs. The goal is to showcase my analytical skills by presenting the outputs of my work.

## RAD-on REST API

​The RAD-on REST API is a publicly accessible interface provided by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education. It offers structured access to extensive datasets concerning higher education, science, and innovation in Poland.​

This API enables users to retrieve data on various aspects such as universities, research institutions, academic staff, students, and scientific activities. By utilizing standard HTTP methods and returning data in formats like JSON, it facilitates integration with applications and supports analytical endeavors.​

For more information and to access the API, you can visit the official documentation page: [RAD-on API Documentation](https://radon.nauka.gov.pl/api/katalog-udostepniania-danych).
